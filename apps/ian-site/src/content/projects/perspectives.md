## Perspectives – Short Screenplay by Ian Slater

A young man donates his “junker” to charity and we see what a huge part of his life the car had become – a love story.

I think this would make a great student film or guerrilla production. All I ask is that you [let me know](http://iancharlesslater.com/contact/) you intend to produce it!
