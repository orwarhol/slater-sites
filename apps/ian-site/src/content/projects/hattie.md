**Logline:**  
A curious teen receives an old typewriter from an elderly neighbor that leads to secrets of the woman’s missing husband, a drowning boy from her dreams, and her long-gone father.

**Synopsis:**  
Fifteen-year-old Hattie McKesson is bright, funny, and determined to be fine—mostly because she doesn’t know what else to be. Her mind runs fast, her emotions run deep, and her nights are stitched through with a recurring dream: a boy in water, close enough to almost touch, impossible to reach.

In the middle of an ordinary summer, Hattie becomes fixated on an old typewriter tied to her elderly neighbor, Mrs. Patterson—an object that feels strangely intentional, as if it’s been waiting for the right hands. What starts as curiosity turns into comfort, then into a question she can’t set down.

Mrs. Patterson is prickly, private, and not at all interested in being “helped.” But beneath the sharp edges is a long-quiet absence: a husband who vanished years ago, and a life built around not talking about it. Hattie, naturally, talks about it anyway.

With her best friend May at her side—steadfast, quick-witted, and brave in the way that matters—Hattie follows faint clues into the glow of a legacy hotel world: old photographs, polished surfaces, and history that still seems to have a pulse. The mystery is real, but so is what it stirs up in Hattie—about family, about memory, about the father-shaped space in her life, and about how you keep going when you don’t get clean endings.

**Hattie** is a family drama wrapped in a mystery—warm, funny, and quietly haunting—about the stories we inherit, and the friendships that help us carry them.
