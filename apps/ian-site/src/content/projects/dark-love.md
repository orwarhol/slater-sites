**Logline:**  
When cynical college student MK Cleary flies to Paris after a desperate message from her estranged sister, she’s pulled into a sleek underworld of luxury hotels, corrupt power, and dangerous desire—where the one woman who can help her may be the one who ruins her.

**Synopsis:**  
MK Cleary isn’t sentimental, and she’s not the type to chase ghosts. But when her estranged sister DJ sends a single, panic-laced message from Paris—*Can you get here?*—MK gets on a plane.

DJ doesn’t show. Her apartment is a curated contradiction: luxury on the surface, survival underneath—cash tucked away, condoms in a drawer, and breadcrumbs that keep pointing to the same sleek hotels where money moves quietly and nobody asks questions. A weary detective offers just enough help to be frustrating, and Paris keeps gleaming like it can’t see what’s happening in its shadows.

Then MK meets Camille Baupin—poised, magnetic, and paying far too much attention. Camille knows the rules of this city’s private games. She offers MK direction, protection… and temptation. She slips MK a gun like it’s an accessory, and MK realizes she’s no longer searching *for* danger—she’s being invited into it.

As MK digs deeper, she collides with Francois Deniau, a real-estate kingpin who treats people like disposable luxuries, and Rene Lagarde, the fixer who makes problems disappear. With each new revelation, MK’s hunger for the truth knots tighter with her pull toward Camille—until rescue and desire become indistinguishable, and MK must decide how far she’ll go to get DJ back… and what she’s willing to become in the process.
