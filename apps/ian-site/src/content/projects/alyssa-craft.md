**Logline:**  
Alyssa wants a normal life. Cassandra wants the truth—loudly. In Sedona, where the desert hums with secrets, the estranged sisters get dragged into a string of supernatural incidents that keeps pulling them back together… whether they like it or not.

**Synopsis:**  
Alyssa Craft thought she’d outgrown the part of her life that didn’t fit in polite conversation—the rituals, the weird rules, the constant sense that the world has a hidden infrastructure humming underneath it. But when she’s pulled back into the orbit of the job she once wanted (and once got burned by), Alyssa finds herself doing the thing she swore she wouldn’t do again: becoming responsible for other people’s unseen problems.

In Alyssa’s world, magic isn’t just mood lighting and myth. It’s a system—ley lines feeding energy into “nodes”—and every town has someone whose job is to keep that system stable. Alyssa is that someone in Sedona: part utility worker, part investigator, part counselor to the magically unlucky. Her tools are equal parts sacred and suspiciously modern: a modified spyglass that reveals curses as floating code, a circle of stones that becomes a containment field, a few spoken lines that can reset a life gone sideways.

Then Cassandra blows back into town—volatile, brilliant, and impossible to quit. She leaves spells like fingerprints, signs them like graffiti, and keeps forcing Alyssa to ask the question she hates most: what if the chaos is also the key?

While Alyssa handles bizarre local hexes, a quiet global bureaucracy watches the network start to wobble. Something is wrong at the top of the system. And Alyssa may not have the luxury of staying on the sidelines.
