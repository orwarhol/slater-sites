Carly is a valued bank employee who gets restless with the limits of her life. She believes money can get her all she doesn't have and devises a way to steal from the bank's biggest depositor. She manages to buy half interest in a beach apartment building with stolen assets and strikes up a relationship with Eric, the building's manager. Even when things go awry, Eric never wavers from his belief that she deserves the happiness she has never known.
