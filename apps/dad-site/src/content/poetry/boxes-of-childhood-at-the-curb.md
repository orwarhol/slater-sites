Down from college, the

young man sorts through the

closet filled with past treasures, willingly

shedding grade school mementos, small

ceramic attempts, unused photos from his high

school yearbook assignments,

the posters of no-longer-

important musicians, trophies,

a small deflated basketball - pieces of his

younger self. Did the neat, clean-freak

father force this? Has the spare bed-

room's organization greater

priority than his history?

The mother is called, requested

by the step mother to see if she might

want to sort through the pile before the trash

truck obliterates those earlier times.

Is this progress?

Has he simply outgrown

the playground photo taken when

he was nine or so that I found discarded

with old rubber bands. I'm swept back to making

lunches caring enough to hold up the

world, stop a flood for them.

How do I put aside

sentiment, separate the demanding

present from the departed sweet days

to tolerate this downsizing? Relax. It's only a

feeling of slipping away. If he's raking off

dead skin, healthier derma lay below.
