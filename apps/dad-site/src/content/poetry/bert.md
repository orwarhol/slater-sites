STUBBORN OLE GOD-FEARING CUSS,

who just happens to inspire me.  
I've had my days of surrender,  
floating, barely breathing at the  
surface of life with my head  
bent up in hopes of waiting  
out one storm or another.

But you, stuffed in that crowded  
room, whacked by nature so hard  
you must sit, while I stand.  You  
keep open your eyes to see what  
I, weaker soul, would have lost  
to pity of my being.

Now, you listen here!  
This is no small thing  
finding hope so far down a  
road where I would have  
been lost.  I am here to  
praise your will.

I say, raise a glass to him,  
for he lends me courage.  
We are all part of your struggle.  
May all you dream be yours.  
May you never be alone.  
May I find your strength.
