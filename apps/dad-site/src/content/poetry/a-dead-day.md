A dead day  
Slept away, empty  
Standing on the Hermosa Strand  
wind-blown, chilly, where the youngest  
ones surely stood in their formative years,  
the moist air no longer mine, Strand runners  
oblivious of the tourist stranger knowing we can’t  
go home again  
Coming back  
behind a late model  
Accord thinking of Mia’s  
struggle to get back to her old  
world, knowing I am doing little to  
assist; not even driving the loved Vanagan,  
having sought solace with an outing lifts my spirits  
A dead day  
Blood sugar  
might be to blame  
The readings are consistently  
uncomfortable; Patrices’ dismay is  
sinking in like a small craft warning with  
no port in sight added to my missing imagination  
Glum emptiness - like the lack of answers for Iraq  
A dead day  
The white cat  
surveys Amapola Ave  
from atop the printer after  
sniffing my diet Pepsi and turning  
away as I have from the day; nothing is  
wrong, I tell myself; the wife is sweet; the house  
is neat; San Francisco beckons, still I am shrunk  
Come night
