The 1976 film with Tatum and Walter,  
_et al_ has staying power, maybe even  
grown in stature over the years.  
That hasn’t stopped a remake just  
released. I’m curious, being a fan of  
the original. But why bother? What’s  
with all these damn remakes? What  
has become of originality? Where  
are the new writers? No wonder  
Hollywood is losing theatre business.  
Their vision has turned inward, or the  
bean counters have totally taken over.  
I’ll bet there are as many geniuses going  
hungry out there as there always were,  
untapped. But now we’re into remakes.  
However, the fall lineup is starting, and  
there is hope for meatier fair. If I’m  
going to pay the South Bay movie prices,  
I want to see something that will grab me.  
I want to laugh and cry, be bowled over by  
the camera work and the soul of the originality.
