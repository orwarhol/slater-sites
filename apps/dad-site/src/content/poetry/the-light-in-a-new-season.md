The upended dresser, its drawers

splayed like the legs of a shot giraffe,

lay for weeks spewing their contents, a

symbol of her life's slipped-away order.

The Western Redbud in her

father's back yard is circled beautifully

by its dropped halo of orange and yellow,

keeping on its purposeful, time-honored path.

The leaves will require raking when they

turn black brown in the coming cold, not unlike

the daughter's dresser, righted with its drawers

contents folded and pushed gently shut.
