I dreamed of my  
dead brother, Jack.  
We were talking about  
a newly purchased house  
in central California somewhere  
that is in need of restoration.  
It was a quick dream;  
very few details, and not  
until I woke did it make any  
sense with me filling in the de-  
tails of what would be re-  
quired.  He was more  
into automobile repair than  
house construction, so I began  
thinking of how I would help him  
with such a project.  My  
head perked up thinking  
of how I could help him after  
he has done so much for all his  
siblings; it was a relief from the  
money business to think  
of working together with  
him on something I under-  
stand.  Then with coffee in  
hand, the reflection seemed  
silly.  We will not pound  
nails together.
