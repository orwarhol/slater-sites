The first snow has yet to fall  
when she screeches into life.  
The tall, reflective mother had lain  
down her books to give birth.  
The father, like a puffed jay preening  
on a snow-laden limb is made king  
by her new life, adding luster to the  
sheen of his first teaching.  
The deep snows lock  
in mother and child as the  
teacher inches over ice to  
his fulfilling classroom.  
His daily return to the mother’s  
cell glows with new life as she  
develops an undetected fever  
from her amputation.  
_Charles Slater written  
1993 about 1960_
