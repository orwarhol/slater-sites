I was a naïve twelve

or so when Harry Randall’s

folks gave me a job at their little

dairy in western most El Segundo.

It was a small herd

and they had one bull

penned away from the girls

and all I knew was if that beast

got out of his pen,

there was big trouble. He

was one ferocious stud who

scared the hell out of the adults.

I had zero understanding

of what the bull had to do with

the girls producing milk, only that

he was dangerous and seemingly a

threat to our very lives. I

would stand by the thick planks

of his pen and look at him in awe

when I had finished running the bottle

sterilizer, always with a

warning from Oren or Harry’s

father about the steam. In his pen,

he seemed nonthreatening, complacent

even, as if his huge muscled

body would just as soon sleep as

do harm. He was actually beautiful

like a young Arnold Schwarzenegger.
