Guided energy drives it forward

trailing sentiment and memory,

a steel marble, a ball bearing rolling

in the moving salad bowl of the universe

round and round, pushed by its weighty habit

of motion, surprised, as its orbital integrity goes

out of round.

A wobble develops

schlepping the heavy sphere

into terminal disinterest of the bowl whose

mission is motion.

Wait! Not yet. Look here.

The orbital trail breaks up like

a staticky cell phone in a long tunnel

losing the instructions. Purpose lumps

out of focus. The stainless surface develops

rust pits no longer rubbed off by the

abrasion of love.

The rump rump sound of

slowing before sight is lost accompanies a

glimpse of the rim of the bowl from its bottom

as it tips out the dust.
