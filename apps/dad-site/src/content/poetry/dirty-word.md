Nothing makes one reflect like defeat.

I drove a hundred miles to cast my ballot

and threw away my vote. America was

attacked and now we have entrenched

in a warring posture, pounding our chest

to the rest of the world imperially.

Don’t mess with oil-consuming, highly

industrialized, mightily militant, God fearing

Us. Might is Right. Our leader has been

vindicated. We are true blue, and our

collective necks are as red as the

stripes on Old Glory.

This morning’s headlines will be filled with

national right wing victories. We have slanted

away from “Ask not what your country can do

for you . . .” We have rallied behind our

Commander In Chief who has sent the aircraft

carrier Abraham Lincoln into Iraqi waters.

Poor liberal, I, can only sit and lick my wounds.

Why do I feel so hurt? What is my weakness

that makes me think as much about the souls

on the sands over the Iraqi oil, as our penchant

for collective justification to gas up our Chevys

and Fords to clog our freeways?

Am I simply wrong, as my comfort-seeking

brother thinks? Where in the Bible that our leader

thumps is justification to take the lion’s share of

the world’s wealth because we can? This morning

I want him to do a little turning of the other cheek.

I long for a softer America.
