At seventy-two, I drink a hell of a lot of

coffee, sometimes in the middle of the

day when my energy sags and I just don’t

want to pick up the damn tool to continue the

great new adventure I’m into. It goes like this:

I wake early while gentle Sue sleeps

with a clear conscious next to me as

peaceful as a lamb, and my first thoughts

are of the smell and taste of coffee and without

even thinking about it, I lump out of bed, find the

slippers I wear on the wrong feet and get downstairs

to scoop the grounds into Mr. Coffee.

I often ponder which mug to use. They’re

mostly different like the years of my life, many

from Pier 1 Imports because Sue can’t pass up

something that clicks with her as both beautiful and

practical, and if the truth be known, there are few things

more beautiful and practical than a coffee mug.

If last night’s supper dishes are on the

counter, I’m not above scrubbing them up

because nothing’s worse than a bunch of dirty

dishes starring me in the face. A place for every-

thing and everything in it’s place some parent must

have whispered in small ears.

It’s not uncommon to sit in front of the

computer with my first mug and watch the

sun rise into the coastal sky and think about

things. It’s a sign of being alive, I have come to

believe. Drink the first coffee and think about being

as the day starts. It’s a prelude for the work.
