In the city  
surrounded by taller  
buildings, a light standard  
directly in front of the second  
story window over looking the traffic  
on the boulevard below, a winged visitor  
arrives.  
A hawk, in  
all its glory, perches  
only a few feet from where  
I sit, a hawk, mind you, those  
wild, soaring creatures that can float  
in the air on breezes, looking down for  
live food  
that skitter  
about in the grasses  
and brush, not in the parking  
lots and on the boulevards of a  
metropolitan area. Big as an adult  
chicken, it was. Maybe it was looking  
to pluck  
a pigeon right out of the domestic air. They are plentiful.
