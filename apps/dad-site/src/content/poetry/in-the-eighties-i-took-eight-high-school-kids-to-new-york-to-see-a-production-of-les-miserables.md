Dear Lord, I was blown

away. Though I had been

in theatre for decades, and

was teaching it, and directing

several shows a year, I

was deeply enough touched

to remember the details of the

production to this very day. The

revolving circular stage

worked wonders for the

movement causing stunning

juxtapositions of the actors

choreographed so the

stage pictures shifted from

second to second lending

an almost dance quality to the

blocking. And the wrenching

music took me to deeper emotional

reactions than I had ever been while

seeing a stage production. And now

some thirty years later, Sue,

Ian and I saw the motion picture

version yesterday, and I was

equally touched, swamped by

the human frailty, the musical

wonderment, the beautiful camera

work without sacrifice to the essence

of the score. If anything the film version

takes us closer to the Parisian

grit and the period of the action,

and the glory of being human when

it comes loaded with dangers and loss.
