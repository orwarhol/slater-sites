His body no longer serves him, and he  
is reduced to the care of others. None  
of his family says it out loud, but think  
the duration of his dying, and the work  
he requires imposes on their sovereignty.  
They have lives of their own, time tables,  
things to do, and like the Iraqi child in  
TIME magazine with both arms blown off,  
the burns on his small body slathered  
with grease, my brother requires someone’s  
attention. They have similar looks in  
their eyes, my brother and the child  
labeled the collateral damage of war.  
Neither can clean himself after bodily  
functions. Their shit is the responsibility  
of those around them. I can barely lift  
my brother from his mechanical bed, and  
slather his lower body with A and D ointment  
to prevent diaper rash, and he has been  
bombed only by disease and age.  
There is reward in his care, and, grateful  
for his release, I will weep at my brother’s  
passing as I was tortured by the images of  
war. I cannot protest mortality the way  
I protest war.
