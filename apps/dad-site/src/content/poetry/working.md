Working productively is

its own reward. Boring paint-

ing allows thinking of more import-

ant things than the completed job,

while exerting a greater

physical effort, that in the

younger days would have

verged on exhilarating, leaves

the old body in need

of rest. BUT, if the job

gets done, it sends in the

awesome perk of _I ain’t dead_

yet . Sure, the old bod'

is slow and reacts to the labor

complainingly. Still the completed

job is its own reward. It’s like defying

time, or eating your favorite

food without consequence. Not

bad, friends. All this upgrading the

rental for the future occupant makes

for tax right offs, a little profit,

a sense of accomplishment, and

roughed up skin on one’s hands plus

developing a sense of being business smart.

Careful now, don’t get carried

away. Perhaps the real cause of

feeling good is the measurable im-

provement of an older property, a kind

of preservation thing for human occupancy.
