My seventeen-year-old German vehicle,  
practical, sweet to drive, timeless  
in design - a box, really, is resurrected  
with a modern Japanese engine,  
finally sorted out by the Russian.  
It now has gobs of power, and though  
I should be attentive of the tranny and  
breaks as well, I am reacting as if it is  
Christmas. It is sweet to sleep in  
under the stars peeking through branches.  
It rides high and looks down the road  
invitingly. I could do the whole country  
in it, following the sun, seeing how they  
live in New Orleans, or just take it to fill  
up down the street at Albertson's.  
I must get it all gussied up, slap some  
Bondo in the dents and slick it over with  
paint, get better tires to bop down the  
road with Billy Joel or Glen Gould, or  
Bob Marley. Lordy, it's sweet.  
Maybe I should name it. _Light My Fire?_  
_Joey?_ _Whitey_, maybe? _Big Guy?_ Hell  
this will take some thought. It's only a  
car, for God's sake. I need to be practical,  
stop thinking about it when I'm not in it.  
So here's to all the world! May everyone  
have a Vanagan and feel as good about  
it as I do. May there be gatherings of  
happy drivers under pretty trees with talk of  
their goodness and our affection for them.
