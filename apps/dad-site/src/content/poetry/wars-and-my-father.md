When I was drafted out of college, and  
Americans were dying at a fierce rate in  
Korea, and Truman’s War put the President  
in political hot water, and my father had  
already been in two armies and had  
been shot in the WWI trenches in  
France, he cried when I got on  
the bus for Fort Ord.  
He had seen the death of war and  
here was his boy called from his well-  
planned life to do battle. Looking back,  
I had the sense of adventure in me.  
I even volunteered for the combat.  
I was willing to be the fodder of  
war for the cause. It was the  
thinking of a politically  
unformed young man following in  
the footsteps of his family. I had yet  
to realize the complexity of pitting boys against  
each other to die for land, or oil, or power,  
or nationalism, or political style. I was  
the perfect fatalist in that ugly brown  
uniform, more than willing to end  
my existence in hopes  
of something better down the line,  
matriculation in the bloodbath of idealism.  
So there was the veteran standing by the bus  
teary-eyed, knowledgeable of war but  
caught up in fatherhood as his cheery  
boy mindlessly headed out like  
a cowboy to fight the Indians  
of his childhood.
