Through the cave, having passed the  
enchanted gate, step up into the dense  
intentional image jumble, pulsing politic,  
art, philosophy, swinging moods north  
east south and west. They were lonely  
and made a world.  
Sink into the rescued davenport and  
scan their determined mix. Consider!  
they demand. Arrange some possibilities.  
Sniff the oriental essence. Peruse the  
titles. Fondle the edges, the curves, the  
woods, the wickers, the books and jars.  
Lights vein over, around, under - painting,  
framing, licking walls, pictures, plants, bouncing  
off unique beer bottle labels - lights that  
almost create their own music. The walls  
hide behind tapestries, curved vases and  
mounts, poles and a mop handle.  
Electric eclectic. Youthful freedom.  
Genesis to be remembered if some madness  
for conformity grabs their hearts and shackles  
them. No. It’s too strong to abandon to  
pale organization. These days will never  
disappear completely. Colors last.
