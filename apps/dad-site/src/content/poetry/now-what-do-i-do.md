I'm 73 with limited energy.  
The fierce struggle to get the floors  
done is over. The party was a  
success. We gathered and talked  
of aging, dying, the hoped-for adventures,  
and love, and the coming births.  
I sat resting after gathering the  
borrowed furniture and coolers and  
looked at the floor as a work of art,  
and realized I don't have to do anything.  
Now what do I do? This is like the  
morning after opening night where  
the Herculean effort has left me  
a little dazed. The relief is not yet  
realized. Rather there is the feeling  
of vacancy as if the killing of war has  
stopped and the remaining lives  
must be reinvented.  
As I balance atop those years  
no longer resilient, less practiced  
in sustaining after a tenacious effort,  
I remember Nelson Rockefeller's death and  
begin a slow smile. It really doesn't matter  
that the next moment is unplanned.
