Springsteen, at the top of one phase,  
sold out, of course, the mid eighties,  
thundering his blue collar magic to so  
many white collars, poets, old protesters,  
bored accountants, taking us along.  
I went too close to opening to leave  
my fear home. My mangled EQUUS  
script tight in my fist, waiting for the few  
songs that didn’t send me heavenward  
to mentally run the longer lines.  
My loyalty was divided between the  
fear of failing publicly and the bedrock  
charge of the music sweeping through me.  
At fifty something having been cast as the  
doctor after lusting for the part, I was  
humbled by The Boss, the master performer  
from Jersey knowing every word in his wordy  
lyrics and keeping the rhythm slamming  
perfectly, plus pushing his strings for two hours.  
All I had to do was memorize the lines.  
But, no. I was humbly torn. I loved his music  
as much as I was pumped to play the doctor  
festooned with British words to decipher  
the horse blinding boy. The intelligent script  
lent me rank. The part was far more glorious  
than the actor, and there I was, worried while  
awash in that full sound pouring from the stage  
churning my very being with aching sympathy  
for songs of love and loss and championing.  
It was two hours not since matched.  
January, 2005 listening to the recorded concert
