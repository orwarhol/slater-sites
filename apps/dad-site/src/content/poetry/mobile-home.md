In 1970 the house was built,  
not from the ground up, of course,  
but pushed up from the ground floor,  
and what an experience to have piggybacked  
the new floor joists to the old ceiling boards,  
then subfloor with 3/4 ply and frame it up.  
I thought it made me a Renaissance man.  
We are now buying a 1967 mobile unit with  
cheesy walls and flexible flooring, but it was  
owned by an old artist, and we are sure his spirit  
hangs there to keep us buoyed. It makes  
economic sense, of course. And the yard  
is arranged with lovely trees. Artistically.  
I think I am slipping on a business suit.  
Oh, I am a house snob. Architecture  
is my favorite art form. It sweeps me along  
the way faith does so many of my siblings and  
offspring and a friend here and there. So  
this mobile thing is a bottom line issue  
and will not prostitute my soul. Right?
