The dreams are back.  
My cyclic pressure pushes  
psychic replays of past  
and present mixed into  
an edgy tangle.  
I am a boy again  
weighted with all my adult  
sins and accomplishments.  
An odd suffering. The  
vanished appear in any  
guise to stir my nocturnal  
storms.  
Fugitive sleep undermines  
clean awakening. Showered  
and dressed hours early,  
unfocused urgency surrounds  
even the morning coffee.  
I am oddly more alive.
