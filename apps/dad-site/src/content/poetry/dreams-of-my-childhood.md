Perhaps it was  
the old Sand Dunes  
Tavern, the uniqueness  
of living in so unconventional  
a manner.  
Or the realization  
that we were different  
which came to me early on.  
Bert’s shame came first then  
probably  
got picked up by  
me, and though we  
handled it differently, it  
was ground in that never  
finished,  
odd place which  
also was the facility  
of great childhood ad-  
ventures. Am I now, all these  
years later,  
a product of that  
time? In part, surely.  
But last night’s dream, set  
there, featuring brother Jack,  
and a truck  
load of mud, and  
an MGTD, and great  
confusion woke me in slight  
despair. I will have to form this  
day in spite  
of that jumbled mind game.
