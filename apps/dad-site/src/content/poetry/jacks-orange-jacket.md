I don’t really know

why he gave it to me

all those years ago, but

I’m guessing Laura didn’t

like its color. It’s

rather like a Cal-trans

worker’s jacket to prevent

getting hit by passing trucks

while working on

the highways. I have

worn it for years for its

warmth. It reminds me of

Jack’s giving habits.

He was the givingest

person I have known. And

Laura has distinctly good taste.

So here on a chilly

December 1st I took

the trash out in the orange

jacket carrying Jack’s memory

with me to the dumpster.
