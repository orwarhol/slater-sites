bathes in the habit of self-aggrandizement.  
Hugs and kisses and clever praises slather in the  
wake of the last performance where the glory has  
vaporized and the performers flail in the  
thinner air of some next show.  
The draining blood of the latest corps that  
didn’t get taken on the road is waded through  
as hands clasp and snippets of the just ended  
triumph are exchanged and the sounds of  
striking the sets invade the reverie.  
Oh fleeting theatrical moment  
thou art over. Do not end. Do not mortal be.  
Let me resurrect thee eternally.  
I am a turned-away lover unable  
to enter and be on.  
Like war, like a lifespan, like a blossom  
wilted, like a painting unfixed and faded  
the created reality which sustained us  
in such heights has had its run.  
Why don’t we sculpt in stone?  
Ah, indeed why? Do performers  
understand better the allure of eternal  
life by virtue of their craft? We build  
it, we play it briefly, it’s gone. We  
do it over and over seeking perfection.  
Are we vainglorious fools?
