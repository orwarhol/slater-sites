Oh no!  
The damn thing is gone  
and my life is suddenly isolated.  
Sue cannot be told that all is well, that  
I want to communicate but the instrument has  
vanished. I have looked everywhere I can think of  
to no avail. All those names with numbers I no longer  
remember are hidden in that little instrument like a body  
part being transported packed in ice from a donor to a waiting  
patient.
