Out the sun porch window, looking south

with the morning sun slanting across the

huge dirt yard, a lone bluebird stands jittery

as a high school boy walks by the chain-link

fence.

School boys are indelible in the memory of

a teacher who loved his work, who lucked

out on his chosen profession. And now, out

here in a temporary home away from the later

children

I am in need of connection. I miss being

the father. I used to put up their lunches in

brown bags and wash their clothes, and ached

with a love of them all. Nothing is wrong as I look

out

this window. Circumstance has disconnected

me physically from those earlier joys, and this

window view comes at a time when mortality is

sticking its limits in the face of my siblings. Yet I

am

buoyed this bright early November morning

struck with an anticipation of Christmas. I want

to gather together some of my feeble poetry in

packages and give them to my daughters and

son.

If they are wanting for a literary finesse, at least

there is no doubt they hold the true spirit of me.

They are my careful attempts to understand

myself. I hope they are more than sentimental

spasms.
