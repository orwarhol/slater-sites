We have shifted out of reason into faith.

The believers are our nation’s majority

whose collective power have given us a

continuation of policy born of predetermined

moral motivation. We are launched on a

righteous path of clear choices.

Never mind that by definition, faith shuts

down the cause and effect of logic. The

Bible gives no permission to wage war, yet

the conformers to the pulpit stood four square

behind the awful reality of ruined cities,

shredded women and children, estimated

over ten thousand dead civilians, that has

inspired the burgeoning growth of the revenge

our continuing President keeps calling terrorism.

Our warring power, of course, is not terrorism,

we are the messengers of God keeping the

world safe from gay marriage and abortion.

About half of us Americans do not think private

lives should be legislated, do not find fulfillment

in war, do not want to relinquish reason to faith.

Some think God disapproves of such extremes.

Some claim God is invented. Some pine for the

fodder of an unjustified war - our dead young soldiers.

Our secular democracy is eschewed by this

cunning Christian Right who demand conformity

to their narrower precepts. Go their way or not at all,

and their stunning victory sets up the opening for

an even greater charge into changing the world

to their image. We moderates shiver.
