More than forty  
years has slipped away  
from the sounds long de-  
parted as I drove aimlessly home.  
Was it the years  
that brought a sense  
of my dead brother, or the  
passing of his funeral site  
as Neil Diamond  
flaunted his recorded  
ego? Or was it hearing the  
actual Hot Summer Night recording  
after the roller coaster  
ride my life has taken since?  
I have always invited feelings  
in, but this sadness arrived without  
a knock.
