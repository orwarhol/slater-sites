I wake with some aches dreading

the jobs of the day before my coffee.

Sitting up against the big pillows, hearing

the shower sound of my early-morning

wife, I sing Amazing Grace as I could

not beside Frances’ grave yesterday.

So many thoughts flood in:

“. . . sing a Protestant hymn,” the

Catholic priest charmed. I smile with

nearly empty mug in hand, remembering

his impish, Irish face with affection,

thinking I could have been Catholic.

But no, I can no more be Catholic

than I can be Protestant. I laid my hand

on her lovely casket poised above her

open grave, looking back to her good

life, not ahead as were the believers.

She used her time gently. I praised her.

The schism in the believers does not

touch me, for God made his fish in the

sea and the redwoods and the fresh water,

and left us to do the best we can. And

our best includes Frank Lloyd Wright,

Louis Armstrong and Shakespeare.

I dress in my Levis and work boots

and head out early to set up the tasks for

the first class. Maybe if I work hard and

achieve my goals, all the good Franceses

will be honored. Being is magnified

in a field of graves.
