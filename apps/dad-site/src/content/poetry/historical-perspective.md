Do you believe in God?

No, my mother told me, and my nine-

year-old world shifted. I had learned the

word _infinity_ somewhere, and had looked up

to the night sky from the sand dunes above my childhood

home, having climbed out my bedroom window with

a couple of blankets after she had told me goodnight.

It had been a shaping moment, that _no_.

It took some years to

understand her east coast Canadian

fear of the French Catholics and my father’s

sin that led the Episcopal Church to excommunicate

her, and her trajectory away from faith. At the time, my

big sister was already a holy roller and an internal schism

quietly churned in me. My mother was my protector, my

sweet guardian full of sustaining humanity.

By Jack Kennedy’s run for

the Presidency and the Republican not-so-

subtle anti-Catholic campaign suggesting the

Pope could influence the White House, I was well formed.

My mother was an American by then and though I don’t

know how she voted, she liked his Bostonian accent

and thought of him as rather princely, rather English

like. Her religion was well forgotten by then.

Religion was pale for much

of the following years until George The Second

stumped for his next run. He surfed on the shoulders

of the Christian Right. The pulpits were ablaze with his praise

and the morally righteous acceptance of his holy war,

and the paling of American goodness. Separation

of church and state took a back seat, and morality

got entwined with sexual preference.

And now arrived at the forming

of his second cabinet and shifting further right

with promises of fixing his warring squandering of our

wealth by reshaping America in the likeness of his passion

for business, I sit wondering about a shift to my mother’s

native land where compassion gets stronger play and few

own guns. It is winter in America as our President’s

war goes poorly.
