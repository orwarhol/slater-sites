Perhaps it is the early morning  
before people wake and the empty  
house, save my sleeping wife who  
must rest for her work day, or this  
old room having been here for so long  
containing the footprints of the  
children gone their separate ways.  
I feel alone, a little used up and set  
aside in this divided world. My  
closest friend argued that my pacifism  
is misplaced as we stood under an oak  
with the campfire dancing upward, and  
factions of my family judge me misguided.  
My convictions feel like chains.  
'Why can't we all just get along,' plays  
sadly in my head. Yet I know we are  
victims of our visions. I can no more  
surrender my sense of life's purpose  
than those who would have me believe  
their way. All my children are here with  
me with small hands and trusting eyes,  
then I blink and the walls are a different  
color and the window frame has changed.  
We are at war. America, the swift and  
fierce, plays nightly on my screen and my  
feeble fist, shaking in protest, is impotent.  
I cannot make the world for those trusting  
eyes to be a shared vegetable garden.  
Nor, it seems, can I pretend acceptance.  
Thus, I am alone, shrunk by my dream of  
bucolic sweetness with no tools to answer  
those with all the answers. I am painted  
into a foolish corner, unable or unwilling  
to take the more accepted path. Come  
light, give me practical tasks to stem my pain.
