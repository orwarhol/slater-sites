His hair is spiked by the hospital bed, with oxygen  
mask straps haltered there, a Roman soldier from  
_Spartacus_. He moves only his eyes like a downed  
horse who senses he will never stand again.  
A respiratory therapist cheerily says he’s  
just fine to the gaggle of his siblings standing  
in fear for him. None of us has an elixir to  
to get him on his feet.  
Through the thick plastic shield over mouth  
and nose, his lips move in talking motions and  
we repeatedly lean in to hear nothing. His voice  
is vapor, unable to carry thanks, or hope or fear.  
His teeth show through. Are you smiling? I ask.  
I think he means to nod yes. Smiling at what, I  
wonder? our lame humor in lieu of tools for some  
reversal, a memory of sailing, a Heavenly trip?  
His older hair is darker than mine. Except  
for his departed muscles, he looks younger  
than I; there is a new dignity at this plateau.  
Without speech, wrapped to his neck in blue  
hospital bedding, oxygen blown in, no ability  
to adjust arms or legs, he weakly squeezes my hand  
to hold us at his side after we have announced  
our leaving. He was known for his _rage against_  
_that last good night_. His going was expected,  
and the delicate matter of timing floated unspoken  
among us, because time is short for us all. His departure  
announces the passing of our era. Now my brother is gone.  
My selfish, demanding, always-thinking brother  
is gone, and I am less than I was before. His late and  
deep faith was pushed on us siblings with missionary  
zeal, perhaps with hopes of a Heavenly reunion.
