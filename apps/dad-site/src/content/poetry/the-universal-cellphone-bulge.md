Helping Casie audition for

her fall play, students

paraded before us

down stage cen-

ter and their

commonality was nearly

all carried cellphones

tucked in their clo-

thing. Call if you

need a ride

mothers can say univers-

ally, knowing full well

there is a line of

communication

from where-

ever they are. So much

more efficient than

pay phones. The

little darlings are

just a touch

away. And it won’t be for

several years that they

won’t bother to look

at their mess-

ages, if the

in-coming call is made at an inconvenient time.
