Sue told me.

I laughed and

said I’d write a

poem about the

idea.

There is some-

thing command-

ing about Christmas

conjuring childhood

memories.

Of course, I may

be mentally lazy on

this. Was it the perm-

ission to come into the

room

with the tree, all

of us children at

once, to see the gifts

Santa placed under the

Tree?

I believed Santa

had done it. I grew

up late. I suspect that

had much to do with going

into a

life of theatre.
