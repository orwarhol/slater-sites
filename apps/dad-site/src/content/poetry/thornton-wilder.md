Was he called Thor?  
In 1960 I read that _Our Town_ was the  
most produced high school play ever.  
It was my first production as a teacher.  
I still remember some of the cast. They  
are heading for sixty-years-old now.  
I did it again when Pat was dying.  
I didn't have the heart to build a set.  
That was 1975. Last night I saw Casie's  
production on the same stage, and  
Thornton Wilder rushed back into  
my weeping conscious  
That man was a genius. He has not  
one sentimental bone in his body of  
work, yet he produces raging feelings  
almost unexplainable in their depth.  
Daily life, love and marriage, death  
are the divisions in _Our Town_.  
Is there much more to life? Not really.  
He covers the Ice Age and War in _By_  
_The Skin Of Our Teeth_. Not bad. There's  
love and politics in there also. I guess he  
didn't get in sports, but what the hell.  
He does peek at technology.  
"Now you know!" the dead choir director  
says from his bitter grave, the unloved man,  
followed by the weeping George at his young  
wife's grave. Mr. Wilder, you gave us a  
Shakespearean juxtaposition. All the  
bitterness in the world will not dampen love.
