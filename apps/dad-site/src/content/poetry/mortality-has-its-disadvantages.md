If you are painting the window sills

for instance, or writing the Great

American Novel, or selling the Porsche

you can't afford, or would like to

change your wardrobe after six

years or so, you don't want to be

interrupted.

Left alone for the next eight hours,

I stroll south and a little west. The

weather has turned threatening,

the sky a silver gray coffin color,

metallic looking, with no depth,

shallow like my remaining time.

Moody.

But not me. There is a touch of

adventure in me as I step, if not lively,

then deliberately, down to the neighborhood

car dealer, Casey's, who has the occasional

interesting merchandise. Not today. They're

shifted, like the grocer putting the older bread

up front.

I'll be cremated to save grave space.

It's no longer funny to say I'll be buried

in my Porsche or Alfa Romero. I slip home

as the rain starts, thinking not of cars but

my children and the sweet wife who

tolerates me with such equity. I prefer

life.

The trick is to visualize completed projects.

Some visits with family to regenerate connections.

Find the damn leak I created when the

roof deck was built thirteen years ago.

And the book; is it worth anything? Is

this sense that I'm on to something

real?
