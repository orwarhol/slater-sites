We sat in my daughter’s comfortable

home and talked of what made me a

pacifist, my non-combatant military

experience and the lieutenant colonel

in New York who said he would not

make it to bird colonel because he

thought war was a form of political

failure. She listened sweetly.

The drive back to the present home

was colored in diffused memories.

The familiar trip, made hundreds of

times felt liquid and unfamiliar,

steeped in my mortality as if having

traveled back to my roots triggered

new wonder of the old places. There

was question of how to fit in to where

and what has been most of my life.

This wonder is not sadness, nor a

sense of a pending end, but baptism

into my sum. All the dead rode with

me those brief well-known miles, and

time congealed. My mother expressed

confusion about our location, and I

explained she died before I built the house.
