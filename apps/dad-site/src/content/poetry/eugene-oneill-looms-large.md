The broadcast biography of him

last night bringing back his tortured

productive genius, including the idea

he might have been a little in love with

death, aligned freshly his inspiration in my

college days.

From this seventy-five years

perspective, in long retirement, years

after _Lion In Winter_, my last connection

to good playwriting - being able to charge

ahead on stage with a sense of human in-

vestigation,

the memory of O’Neill seems as

fresh as my long departed youthful

ambitions. He was the embodiment of

of hope for connection, for recognition, no

matter that

what became of me, is of little

concern to anyone beyond the

few remaining friends and family.

But this man has left a pathway for

future dramatists as concrete as man’s

struggle for meaning.
