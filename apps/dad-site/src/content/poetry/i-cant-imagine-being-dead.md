I want to sit facing east before  
the San Jacinto peak at the  
computer inventing the particulars  
of a life that unfolds in my head.  
First we must build the wall full  
of windows where the lower plate  
in the framing is bolted down to the  
poured slab with the nuts cranked tight.  
Long before that, on my brother’s  
Chinese tractor, I must clear the pad  
so the foundation trench can be dug  
and the forms laid up for our house.  
I know from the many years of my  
eyes attempting to see things as  
they truly are that the aching muscles  
and little joys of building will soon  
Consume me, inflating my sense of  
living, like a first love all over again.  
My mind races ahead to the glow plug  
on the tractor springing the machine to life.  
I must take a breath and do all the things  
in the order required so that I can sit  
facing east with my fingers on the keyboard  
thrilling to the illusion of casting ideas in stone.
