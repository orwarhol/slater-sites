There is time to think  
of the moment only if I  
have consciousness; I do  
mean, mind you, the act of being  
un-asleep.  
Thoughts are relative.  
I can be quite awake but  
mentally dozing like wind blown  
clouds changing shapes, drifting,  
un-alert,  
standing at some chore  
mindlessly, actually using  
a tool without connecting to  
the task. Could be dangerous,  
un-productive.  
But the worse scenario  
is presuming some philo-  
sophical accuracy when I  
have missed the point, erred  
un-beknownst.
