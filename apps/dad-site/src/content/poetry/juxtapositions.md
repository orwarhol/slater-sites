I am next to the palm tree just

before the slope down to

Silver Street before it was

uprooted, before the middle

girls were born, before the

first letter of the first word

of the first book was struck.

I am grouped with my young

siblings and my mother and

father cleaned up for some

photographer brought in to

catch us as an unsophisticated

family in that shameful old

rattletrap of a converted tavern.

I am standing behind the

bamboo curtain made up

to look Japanese poised to

say the first line of _Teahouse of_

_the August Moon_ with my mother

in the audience who will not

recognize me that close to her end.

I am standing beside my

oldest brother before my

father's coffin as he slips the

watch off his thin wrist, unable

to know what to think that the

brother's gift to my Dad will

not be buried with him.

I am standing before my first

classroom almost delirious after

the birth of my daughter full of the

joy of fatherhood, having experienced

none of the mother's birthing

pains, just grateful that life

will carry on beyond myself.
