The new church is still only a shiny, steel  
skeleton standing beside the revival-meeting  
tent for the throngs of Easter faithful,  
gathering to celebrate the resurrection.  
I am greeted affectionately by friendly  
strangers presuming I, too, have come to worship.  
But no; I come to deliver my faithful brother in  
his wheelchair to the rousing songs and prayers.  
There is a sweetness here. I am told  
three times that I am welcome, that there is  
always room for another. My brother smiles  
up to me, joining in their welcoming.  
Hoisted out of his bed for the first  
time in a week, I feel he will be cradled  
in them. He had insisted. Being here  
gives him a sense of coming home.  
I left the time-honored ritual to go down  
the road to make my morning, secular coffee,  
warmed by the effort to get him here, awash in  
the memories of my son on his sailing ship in Mexico.  
How fitting that we gather here today at the  
last place he came to worship. The mechanics  
of his mortality are done; we who care are shifting back to  
our individual lives, hoping our imperfections might also be forgiven.
