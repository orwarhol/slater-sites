The sixty-one high school kids  
jogged past me as I ate my  
sausage McMuffin and  
egg on the running  
path. I counted  
them as they  
passed.  
Mira Costa? Redondo? I didn’t  
ask. A young man said good  
morning to me and I gave  
him the same. Their  
effort kept them  
focused on  
their  
task. They had yet to work up  
a sweat making me think  
they were not far into  
their workout. It  
brought back  
memories  
of my  
thirty-four years in the class  
room. Had I been some-  
thing like an accoun-  
tant without a mem-  
ory of thirty plus  
faces staring  
back at  
me, this morning would have  
had less impact. I know  
I can’t go back, but as  
I ate my tasty food,  
walking with some  
vigor, I was in  
familiar  
territory.
