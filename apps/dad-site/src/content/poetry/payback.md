---

As a boy I watched my 19th century mother  
wash seven sets of sheets every Monday  
in the machine with the rhythmic agitator  
sounding like drums in elevator music.  
The swan-necked drain hose emptied  
into the sink where she did the dishes, her  
singular, God-decreed obligation after each  
crowded meat and potatoes offering.  
She would run the sheets through the wringer  
into the sink, refill the rinse water onto the  
squashed cottons reloaded into the round  
tub, standing gratefully still as if watching  
the flow of a lovely trout stream. I never  
lifted a hand, never thought I should as I saw  
her fate as a Mississippian might watch a lynching.  
Whitish sheets in that brown house in that sepia  
snapshot. My older van, tricked out with a  
modern engine does not idle smoothly at a red  
light. I must slip the automatic transmission into  
neutral. It is I who is in automatic, hardly having  
to think as if sitting with my feet in a stream  
and leaning my face to the sun between the time  
I have picked up the gadget from the hardware and  
getting back to the makework that keeps me breathing.
