Acquired wisdom

slips through the cracks

of diminishing memory.

Old mastered procedures

become annoying; no more

doing without careful

arrangement, step by

step. The familiar seems

new, inexperienced.

Assurances are fewer

and farther between,

puddled in doubt.

No mystery, just the

surprises of the duration

hoofing the planet.

Whose puffy image

is that walking toward

the reflecting glass?

Now, that’s a surprise!

The old plans that have

carried me all this time

are daunting. Let’s

be real. I’m not going to

build another house.

Wait! Wait just a damn

minute here. There is so

much I need to learn.
