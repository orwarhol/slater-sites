There we were dancing  
upstairs by the window wall  
Nicole and Casie and I, maybe  
when they were four and five, maybe  
to Dylan’s Hey Mr. Tambourine Man.  
The sweet memory floats  
in on the old music like a gift.  
Life has moved on complicatedly.  
It is no surprise to me that life is still  
the ongoing book of hope. ‘Tis still good  
to breathe, to see them  
now and again and measure  
their rewards. And the joys of  
the periodic get-togethers with all  
of them displaying their individualities.  
Stay earthbound, Charles.
