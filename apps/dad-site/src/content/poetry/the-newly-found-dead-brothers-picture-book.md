sits on the dining table for now,  
too precious yet to store.  
Proof of a past — of  
mortality.  
Such fun in the humid Mexican heat,  
the clear waters a blessing.  
The intelligent boy  
active  
after the breakup of his family.  
He leaps from his uncle’s  
boat into the tepid gulf  
waters  
where he flies to rescue his dad.  
The little-boy bravery is  
balm for his father’s  
unwinding.  
The photos are at once a record  
of an escape, a week off from  
the turmoil of  
change,  
and evidence that we all must shift,  
as best we can, onto  
a platform of  
continuance.  
We went on to my brother’s end and  
my son’s growing to manhood,  
and the healing of my  
soul.
