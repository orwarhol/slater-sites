The Sunday Trains

come through clogging weekend

traffic like a fatty buildup in veins.

I dashed out from the new little

house at the first distant whistle,

afraid I would miss standing by

the tracks close enough to touch

the huge cars.

I needn’t have worried. On Sundays

they forego the Alameda corridor and

bring through the freights much of the

day to the consternation of the locals.

I stood right next to a stopped freight car

after the screech of breaks. I could

have climbed on and dropped off on

the other side to buy the _Sunday_

_Times_ at Albertsons. There’s a small

cat walk on each car for just that. The

tracks are a half block from here if I go

out the back gate. This has been my

neighborhood since 1962 when I started

at Torrance High and had a student

who lost one of his legs putting pennies

on those very tracks. I remember his

boyish face and telling me that he still

loved trains, and explained he was on

his third leg, but that he was through

growing. I, too, am still enamored by the

sounds and size of a train, and I’m back.
