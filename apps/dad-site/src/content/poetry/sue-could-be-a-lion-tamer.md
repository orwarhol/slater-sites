She doesn’t hesitate  
to pick up Pele after the  
little beast has been shredding  
one piece of furniture or another.  
She simply scoops her  
onto her shoulder with a  
little “now, now, you know  
better than that” as her gnarly  
husband quietly considers  
drop kicking the cat through the  
gold post of life.  Oh sure, she plays  
soccer like a pro and has a kind of  
psychotic sense of humor,  
and does horizontal jumps off the  
back of the leather sofa after approach-  
ing it from the back of the house at 60 mph.  
But Sue is not daunted.  
“She’ll calm down; we’ve only  
had her a couple of months.”  It  
just seems longer to narley Charlie.  
“We’ll just put her in time  
out when she’s bad, and let  
her know we love her, and civilize  
her fury little butt.”  You can bet the  
farm on it.  Sue and Job have things in common.
