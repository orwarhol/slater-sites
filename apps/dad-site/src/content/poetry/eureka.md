Seldom is there the kind of thunder  
and lightning as we had last night  
with such volumes of rain. Dramatic;  
prevented sleep; our bedroom turned  
blue white in the strikes before the crashes.  
The house did not fall down; sleep  
eventually came in spite of the storm.  
And this morning the kitchen was not  
flooded. You understand what that means,  
I take it? The leak is stopped.  
Ah, it’s nothing.  
Lord Charles, the Builder Man Mid February, 2005
