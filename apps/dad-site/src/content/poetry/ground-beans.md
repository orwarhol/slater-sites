The high pitched whine of the grinder disturbs  
the early morning like a banging screen door  
across a graveyard.  
The charm of the pet’s waking routines and  
the surprising brightness of the moon  
hanging low between  
the palms as if waiting to challenge the sun  
are jarred by the sounds of attack somewhere  
in the valley.  
I sit in the huge empty yard waiting for the morning  
headlines of encroaching war, listening to the noises  
of a coyote pack.  
Their crescendo alerts me to the innocent play of the  
dog and cat. Though amongst houses, we are close  
to the hills.  
The crowded earth is shared by nature’s predators  
and nation’s war machines, and the political wherewithal  
to force issues.  
I cannot escape my worldly citizenship as the growing  
light defines the perimeter of the property and the lines  
of the surrounding houses.  
The wild animal sounds have ceased as sun peacefully  
reaches the tallest hill and my remaining coffee is as cold  
as a dead soldier’s blood.
