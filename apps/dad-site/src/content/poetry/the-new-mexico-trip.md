Portales has some unloved curbs and driveways,  
victims of age and too little thought about  
design, and some root intrusion. The town  
full of sweet-natured people doesn’t care.  
Nothing is left to chance in bustling Santa Fe  
where Southwestern design might have been  
born. There must be a committee in charge of  
arches and ceiling height and courtyard sizes.  
For the uninitiated, the spruced-up old walls  
and ancient, arched doors wearing time added  
to their surfaces set in walls built yesterday,  
they might get swept up in the formula beauty.  
But those sweet-natured, unhurried Portales  
folks always say their thank yous to strangers  
with utter sincerity over the old tables at public  
breakfasts. Some of those sadder, limping  
houses by the forgotten-about curbs could use  
coats of paint, but... The soul-attentive  
residents evoke a peaceful essence in their  
daily routines. There is a wealth here in spirit.  
When one travels north from Portales to Santa  
Fe, through hours of openness at eighty miles  
per hour, the arrival is initially celebratory, full of  
awe for the consistency of lovely brown walls.  
This made-for-the-public art-for-sale center  
with the world’s most expensive Mexican food  
available at Café Pasqual’s will sit well with the  
roadies. Love of travel is fulfilled here.  
Arrival back home brings comparison. Little  
Portales with the university tall and clean just  
a jump from the lovely brick homes contentedly  
nestled in big tree-filled yards is timeless and  
worthy – the place to raise the family. Santa Fe  
is slickly beautiful, peopled with sharp-eyed,  
articulate pushers of art. They have the need  
sized up the moneyed appreciators of pretty things.
