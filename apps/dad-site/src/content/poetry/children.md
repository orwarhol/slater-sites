Today at The Aquarium of the Pacific I saw a  
child’s face with the look of perceptive age, of  
worry beyond her years as if she understood  
war, and life expectancy, and defeat.  
She brought back the memory of being with  
my middle children stuck in a restaurant when  
the old Fiat died on the way to Springville, and  
the waitress told me our dinner had been paid  
for by a big rig driver who had already left. I  
understood he must have seen the joy I got  
from the girls in spite of car trouble. He must  
have longed for his own children seeing mine  
making a good time out of a mishap. And in  
the child-filled aquarium today, humbled by the  
compelling beauty and variety of sea life, I was  
subdued by Sue’s sweet successes with babies.  
My ancient personage, too late to be the father  
in her mothering, closer to death than child-  
bearing years, I am swamped with her loss  
even though she denies interest. How can  
one so connected to the little ones have no  
interest? No, it is the span of years between  
us from which there is no escape, and the gentle  
lady must make do with her earlier choice.
