We pretend the discipline of once-a-day feeding,  
old raggedy assed Coco and the Queensland Heeler.  
They do their morning dance as the dishes are put before them  
with steam rising through the dry food from the heated weenies.  
It is their moment of glory.  
This cold snap has got to me, too; I see them at the glass  
door having gulped their food, their tortured eyes expecting  
sympathy from the cold. I too have tortured eyes, seeing no solution  
to the broken completion of the book. Up here at my writing perch,  
I watch old Joe arrive on the block.  
It’s Thursday, trash day, and the sweeper comes to  
our side of the street and Joe must park on the east side.  
Bundled against the cold, he moves slowly at his first house  
with clippers in one hand snipping off the hedge runners poked out,  
delaying taking down the heavy mower.  
Coco preens in the patch of sun on the hardwood  
while Alice watches Sue pluck her brows before the upstairs  
mirrors. I sit dumbly in pajama bottoms and sweatshirt, my imagination  
somewhere else, daunted about money and the coming Christmas and what  
my youngest will do with herself.  
The motor noise of Joe’s power edger drifts up carrying  
memory of our first meeting some years ago when the oldest  
rented at my brother’s place one town north, and since then the  
world has dramatically shifted. This cold can be pushed against with  
purposeful activity yet to come to mind.  
I must muster some purpose, pick up the first tool,  
whatever it is to be, dress for cold and find hope the way  
Joe does with his maintained gardening machines. I can see  
him thinking from here as he rolls down the mower. He’s my man,  
politically. We both lost bigtime.  
“Sonsabitches” he calls the present administration.  
“They’re not Canadians!” Joe says. “They wouldn’t know  
peace if it hit ‘em in the ass.” He gets out his eight foot ladder  
and stands on the not-a-step top to perfectly round off the treetop  
of his number three house. Little Joe is 68.
