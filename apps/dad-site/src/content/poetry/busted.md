Have you been drinking?

I don't drink, I lied.

You didn't have a little something

at your brother's? It's the season.

I don't drink.

His light shone in my eyes

after I had trouble nervously getting

my license out of my wallet and

answered yes about the correctness

of the address.

That's a fifty-five zone

where you passed me at seventy.

You sure you haven't been drinking?

Nope. I was humble and apologetic.

Hope grew that he wouldn't write me.

Where was my automatic hostility?

My dislike for authority and profit margins?

I was hurrying home to Sue in my fun,

pepped-up Vanagan, after my

siblings had made me feel welcome.

It was post Christmas. I wore that old

holiday sadness covered by my pushy

arrogance. The realization that I am not

a Renaissance man, not able to do

everything alone, softened me.

I believed him when he said he

didn't want to pull my bloody self out of

the van over the rain soaked road.

Not fun, he said. Put on your seat belt,

don't speed, be safe, he said.

He was maybe twenty-eight twenty-nine

with a nifty mustache, maybe a father

I thought, maybe a couple of years of

college. I drove consciously for

the next seventy miles.
