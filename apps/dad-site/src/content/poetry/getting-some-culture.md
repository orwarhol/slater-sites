This morning early, after yesterday having seen

the Renoir poster child, Matisse and Degas, et al,

I wonder what has transpired.

Yes, I was spoken to, I felt that I was in the company

of masters. I had leaned in close to look for brush

strokes and spatula marks.

The museum concept - bringing people to move in

uniform order before the mounted works, not lemmings

off the edge, but souls in wonder,

has me wondering. All that money, all that praise,

all that cultural awe. Am I supposed to have taken away

a deeper humanity? Is it that

artists of past centuries are the best historians because

they convey a sense of blood coursing through the veins

of their subjects? I was with them,

sensing their flirtations and tipsy joys, and melancholy.

I was of their time, capable of adjusting their clothing,

or kissing a cheek.

The hordes of uniformed school children who trooped

through in line, looking more at the people looking than

at the paintings, one presumes

by just being there and not doing any damage, something

will have rubbed off. Perhaps education is a hope swimming

in exposure. Of course their

beautiful little faces competed with the paintings to some of the

hopefuls there who came to glean the past artistically captured. Am

I better because of yesterday? Probably.
