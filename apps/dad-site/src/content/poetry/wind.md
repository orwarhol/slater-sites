This morning before the oppressive

heat arrived, new life danced across

the fields through the tall grasses

with the trees swaying rhythmically.

Ziggy meowed until I let him out to witness

the land come alive as if on the cusp

of some adventure. He settled down by

me to let me know we shared something new

before slinking out to the fields to do his

cat thing with the mice and birds. Don't stop

wind! Stay and play on the land. Accompany

the day's labors. Push away the heat.

I sat thrilled on the front porch in the

beginning light before the sun raised

it's summer might over the eastern

horizon. The stranger had entered smiling.
