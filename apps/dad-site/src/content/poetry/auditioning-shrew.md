As the moth  
at the flame,  
so I stutter  
and bounce  
toward the  
wrenching  
decisions of  
the next three  
months. The  
mind tries to  
compress the  
unit, bend it  
to a known  
totality.  
Impossible.  
But, Lord, it’s  
exciting, So  
much better  
than elevating  
the mundane,  
than lending  
importance to  
a potato of  
a script. Let  
us attempt  
to grasp  
Shakespeare’s  
comic genius.  
March on,  
reason.  
Slater, Spring, 1985
