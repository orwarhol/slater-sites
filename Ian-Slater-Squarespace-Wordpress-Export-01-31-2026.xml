  <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It all started when...</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ian Charles Slater was born on June 20, 1982 in Los Angeles, California. His father, Charles Slater, is a high school drama teacher, and his mother, Ilene Slater, is a mental health specialist. Ian grew up acting in plays directed by his father and, more recently, the two collaborated on a feature film. Ian began his college education studying Film Production and Creative Writing at San Francisco State University, and obtained his bachelor's degree in Communications.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In 2016, Ian’s feature screenplay, <a href="/hattie-screenplay-by-ian-charles-slater">Hattie</a>, won an Honorable Mention in the Fresh Voices Screenplay Competition and was a Finalist at the Richmond International Film Festival (RIFF). He saw his first success in television writing in 2017, advancing to the semifinals at CineStory along with his writing partner, Matt Penna. The two also attended the foundation's retreat. Ian has worked with film directors George Pappy, known for Few Options, and Vitaly Sumin.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ian became the luckiest man in the world when he married his wife Emily, on April 30, 2016.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p><strong>A short horror movie. Written and produced by Ian Slater, directed by Micah Caldwell, starring Courtney Hart, and set in West L.A.</strong></p><p>Eden brings her small town goodness with her to the streets of Los Angeles. She gets a job at a local movie theatre and makes a few easy friends. But wherever Eden goes, she sees a man watching her. He's a homeless man. They all look the same, her friend Ben tells her, nothing to be worried about. Eden's fear consumes her. She smells the man's sewer sickened breath around every corner. Leaving work one winter's night, Eden spots the homeless man. He begins to follow her. She seeks refuge in a misplaced saloon with a strange bartender and a trio of douche bags. The boys trap her in the dark corner of a parking lot, and what happens next is something even the savviest of city dwellers would not have expected.</p>

      <title>A Bombay Beach Story</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/6/bombay-beach-story</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2>We took a drive out to Bombay Beach, on the forgotten Salton Sea, and met an unlucky traveler in need of assistance.</h2><p>First, meet <a target="_blank" href="http://society6.com/ddpvk">Diana</a>. Diana is my best friend and partner-in-crime. She has a weenie dog named Bentley, who we often refer to simply as, “The Man.” The three of us go on adventures together. This was one such adventure… I told Diana I wanted to celebrate my 32nd birthday by taking a drive out to the Southern California desert. Most of Southern California is desert, but I wanted dry, hot, wide-open desert. Sand and desolation. Blinding sun. Something out of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091209/">The Hitcher</a>, minus the stalker in a big rig. Road-stops with ice cream and Carl’s Jr. and sticky pavement and the smell of gasoline. Sometimes you want those things. We got on Highway 111 and the places started to get weird. This is where people pass through. These are the places we stopped. First:</p><h2>Carniceria Toro Loco — Access &amp; Vander Veer Rds.</h2><p>No ice cold Mexican Fanta to be had here. Forget about Titanic on VHS. This structure was complete with payphone, broken glass, and employee schedule. Maria would not be coming to work tomorrow. It didn’t look abandoned long. And whoever left seemed to have done so in a day’s time, loading up a truck and bailing out, leaving behind containers of pigs feet. When the zombie apocalypse comes, someone will fortify this place…but probably die anyway.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>We continued up 111. After awhile we reached…</p><h2>Bombay Beach</h2><p>A sign and a palm tree welcomed us. They had each other as company, in a place where there’s not much company to be had.</p>
</div>

























  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1600"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56b7d7f927d4bd6c662e8de5/1498419128146-UWYFK5115ZATNCJE7RPA/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=" Bombay Beach Welcome Sign "/>  Bombay Beach Welcome Sign [/caption] 
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>We turned at the sign and were on a dirt road. Sure didn’t look like no beach, no sea neither, but Siri seemed to think this was the right way (go 1.1 miles then “prepare to park your car”…or drive into the sea, is the part she didn’t say). At first glance it was a post-apocalyptic trailer park. Plenty of gutted and abandoned dwellings. Peer through the open doorways, graffiti on the walls, references (appropriately) to Dante’s Inferno.</p>
</div>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Every now and then something cared-for: a lawn, a one-story house with clean windows, a roof with current satellite dishes. Still, if you’re compiling a list of “Top 10 Places to Hideout,” Bombay Beach needs to be on it. We turned again and there it was: The stillest body of water you’ll ever see. So flat, so wide, so dry. The driest wetness. Try and stare to the edge and your eyes will burn. Get close and you get the smell, something like sulfur and dead fish. Walk along the edge and the crackle beneath your feet, walking on Rice Crispies. It was enough to possess Diana and Bentley. They looked out on a forgotten sea — one that was never supposed to be. Listen hard enough and you can almost hear the casinos, the excitement, the voice of Sinatra, long since faded.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>We sat in the car and listened to the nothing, felt like Dali clocks melting in the desert. Then, about 50 yards away and partially obstructed by a sand dune we noticed a man — a fellow tourist parked in the sand. He sat in the open passenger seat of his car, and wore a tan fedora, shorts and sandals. He wasn’t enjoying the nothing like we were. He was trying to solve a problem. We muttered something about how he didn’t look to be from here. Too hip. And we focused back on the sea. A few Dali minutes passed and there he was again, this time approaching our car. “My car’s stuck in the sand…wondering if you might give me a push.” This was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ptphotography.com.au/">Peter Tarasiuk</a>. “Sure, no problem.” I listened to his predicament and thought, <em>piece of cake</em>. The four of us walked over to Peter’s car and examined the situation. Oh, it was bad. His car had certainly tried to drive into the ground. Not even worth a push.</p>
</div>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>“I don’t have AAA. I even tried buying a membership. But they won’t do anything for me since I’m not a citizen.” Peter was here on-assignment for an Australian magazine. He had a couple days off and had decided to explore the Salton Sea. “I have AAA.” Diana to save the day! But of course, it wouldn’t be that easy… Good news is it was only the first day of summer. The air temperature held at 104 degrees while we waited those 2 hours for the tow truck to arrive from El Centro. We had plenty of water, bananas, and need for a tan. But dachshunds don’t do so well in the heat. The Man panted over his water bowl, allowing sand to get all over his mouth and not caring. He even hobbled out of the shade of Peter’s car to join us as we played Heart &amp; Soul on a piano which just so happened to be there, and in-tune, amongst the wreckage.</p>

  <p>We had no complaints. We came in search of adventure, and adventure had found us. It took the tow truck driver a couple attempts to free Peter’s car from the Bombay Beach quicksand.</p><p>Peter thanked us with a photograph taken on his <a target="_blank" href="http://focusingdaily.blogspot.com/2013/08/polaroid-250-land-camera.html">1976 Polaroid camera</a>. And that was our time-machine. That completed our journey, honoring these places once filled with joy, now ghostly reminders of the cruelty of time.</p>
